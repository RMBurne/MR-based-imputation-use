# MR-based-imputation-use

This code repository was created to demonstrate the use of martingale-based imputation, as described in the paper: Burne and Abrahamowicz (2016) "Martingale residual-based method to control for confounders measured only in a validation sample in time-to-event analysis"

*  `MR-based-imputation.R` - functions to perform martingale-based imputation
*  `examplecode.R` - explains how to use the functions included in `MR-based-imputation.R`, and describes the output
*  `simdata_TF.RData` and `simdata_TD.RData` - simulated data used to demonstrate the use of the functions in `examplecode.R`
